# Group-List-Image-Boxes
This GitHub repository contains a web development project that showcases a user list interface with various interactive features. The project is composed of three main files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

## 1. `index.html`
- This HTML file serves as the main structure of the web page.
- It includes metadata like character set, viewport settings, and links to external resources.
- The page presents a user list displayed in image boxes, with pagination and filtering options.
- It imports an external stylesheet (`styles.css`) and JavaScript file (`script.js`) to enhance functionality.

## 2. `styles.css`:
- This CSS file defines the visual styles for the web page.
- It sets the layout, font, and styling for various page elements.
- Notable styles include user cards with hover effects, pagination buttons, and user data containers.
- The CSS file ensures responsive design for different screen sizes.

## 3. `script.js`:
- The JavaScript file provides dynamic functionality to the web page.
- It fetches user data from an external API (`https://reqres.in/api/users`) and populates the user list.
- Users can navigate through pages using pagination buttons.
- The user cards have hover effects that display additional user information.
- Users can filter the displayed users by their first names using a dropdown menu.

The project showcases a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface for displaying and interacting with user data. The code is well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
